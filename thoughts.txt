For each idiom examine the following:


1) Are rhythms in melody and harmony related?


2) If they are, according to which features?
Are their distances similar for each measure? (could be related according to different subsets of features for different idioms)


3) Are rhythms patterns per-piece "significantly" different in different idioms? If so according to which features?


4) Are successions of rhythmic patters "complying" with the 1st order Markov assumption? ("Relatively" fixed probabilities for pattern transitions)


5) What are the inter-idiom and extra-idiom distance relations in rhythms according to different metrics (e.g. Toussaint distances, or feature-based distances).


6) Are some idioms closer to others (regarding harmonic rhythm)?
Extra/future step, is harmonic rhythm enough for identifying musical idioms?



What we deal with: harmonic changes on a level of harmonic reduction (what level? is it cognitively grounded?), in the form of rhythm sequences.


What we don't deal with: the expression of rhythmic harmony on the level of texture - surface.



Possible objectives:


1) Analyse features of harmonic rhythm on reductions and relations between these harmonic rhythm sequences in different idioms.


2) Examine possible relations between harmonic rhythm in reductions and melodic rhythm in the respective segments.


3) Propose a generative model of reduction harmonic rhythm for melodic harmonisation, that learns from data, based on rhythmic features,
transitions of rhythmic patters and relations between melody and harmony rhythm.


4) (Kai-Uwe would be so happy :)) examine whether blending can fit in the picture...
